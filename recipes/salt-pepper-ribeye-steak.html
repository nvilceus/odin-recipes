      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Salting the ribeye steak two days prior to cooking brines the steak, helps tenderize it, and adds rich flavor. </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>6 (8 ounce) rib-eye steaks</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt</li>
          <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Two days before cooking, salt both sides of each steak with 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt per steak. Place steaks 
              in an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
          <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steak with black pepper.</li>
          <li>Heat cast iron pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil and heat until oil shimmers.</li>
          <li>Carefully place steaks in pan. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Turn steaks and top with one teaspoon butter. Cook for 3 to 4 more minutes or to desired doneness. You may need to cook the 
              steaks in batches depending on the size of your cast iron pan. Keep the cooked steaks in a 170 degree F oven until ready to 
              serve.</li>
        </ol>
