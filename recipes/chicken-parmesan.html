     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>Tender chicken breasts coated with breadcrumbs, baked with marinara sauce, topped with 
       mozzarella cheese and accompanied by pasta with tomato sauce and freshly grated Parmesan.</p>
     
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>2 medium garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
         <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
         <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
         <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
         <li>2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each), halved crosswise</li>
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
         <li>8 ounces spaghetti or linguine</li>
         <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
         <li>1/2 cup grated part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
         <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
         <li>In a large saucepan, heat garlic and 2 Tbs. oil over medium-high heat until garlic starts to sizzle. Stir in tomatoes, 
           basil, oregano, sugar, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring to a simmer; simmer until sauce thickens a bit 
           and flavors meld, 10 to 12 minutes. Cover and keep warm. (Remember, this makes twice the amount of sauce you need, so put 
           aside half for another meal.)</li>
         <li>Put chicken pieces between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound, using your fists or a heavy pan, until the cutlets are 
           about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
         <li>Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large soup kettle.</li>
         <li>In a pie pan, beat egg until well-blended. In another pie pan, mix bread crumbs and more black pepper. Preheat broiler.</li>
         <li>Working one cutlet at a time, dip both sides of each in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs. Put cutlets on a wire rack set 
          over a cookie sheet (this step helps breading stay put).</li>
         <li>Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil over medium-high heat in a 12-inch skillet. When oil starts to shimmer, add cutlets and saute 
           until golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes total. Wash and dry the wire rack and return to cookie sheet. As the cutlets 
           saute, cook pasta in boiling water according to package directions.</li>
         <li>Transfer cutlets to clean wire rack over cookie sheet. Top each with a portion of the cheeses. Broil cutlets, 4 to 5 inches 
           from heat source, until cheese melts and is spotty brown.</li>
         <li>Drain pasta. Put a cutlet and a portion of pasta on each of 4 plates. Spoon 2 or 3 tablespoons of sauce over part of each 
           cutlet, then sauce the pasta as desired. Serve with extra Parmesan.</li>
     </ol>
